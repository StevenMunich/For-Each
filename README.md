# For-Each
A look at For Each used in Java from a C++ perspective using void pointers.
The C++ files are to read in depth how forEach works and to understand that a function is being passed to another function. 
ForEach.cpp
ForEach2.cpp
ForEachAccessable.cpp
ForEach-Mutable.cpp

In the java example System.out.println is passed into forEach.
The Java file is to show how often it is used in Java.
Main.Java

Finally, it introductes the concept of void pointers. To make it easy, remember what is a pointer? A MEMEMORY ADDRESS.
so it can point to an int, long, char, float, it does not know yet. More at 
VoidPointer.cpp
